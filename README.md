# Employee Performance and Attrition Prediction
**Introduction**

Employees are the backbone of any organization. The success of an organization is heavily dependent on committed employees who are motivated and productive to carry out a company's goals and objectives.

Thus, employee attrition, the rate at which employees leave their job, hurts the growth and performance of an organization in terms of financial profit, productivity, and time. However, attrition is an inevitable part of any business. There will come a time when an employees wants to leave a company, which can happen for many reasons. For instance, employees might be seeking for better opportunities, mentally illed, working excessive hours, working in a toxic atmosphere or under bad management, etc. But when attrition reaches a particular threshold, it becomes a concern to be addressed as it may be reflecting a deep problem with the company culture. Attrition is particularly concerning when the attrition rate is high, indicating that employees are turning over pretty quickly, or when early attrition rate is high, indicating new joiners leave the company within the first few years of employment. Therefore, it is important to ask questions, find out why people are leaving, and understand what is influencing attrition rate within an organization.

The most important question to ask is what factors are contributing to more employee attrition? Thus, by understanding these reasons for employee attrition, a company can take the correct measures to retain their employees.

To explore these correlations, we used an IBM Employee Attrition dataset to explore and visualize interesting and significant factors that lead to higher employee attrition. We have done this using matplotlib and seaborn.

Further, we have used trained multiple machine learning models like to predict whether an amployee would leave an organisation based on various input columns that cover the factors for employee attrition.

Finally, we have compared the performance of these models using various performance metrics like precision, recall, f1-score, etc.

# Data
For this project, we have used an IBM employee data set hosted on Kaggle that contains various personal and professional information about an employee (i.e. Attrition, Age, Monthly Income, etc). The dataset was last updated in 2017 and does not have any missing data, which makes it easier to work with.
